This project was developed when i first learn by my own how to handle html/css and Php.
I used wamp at home to run my project as i hadn't access to an online server like we use to have
in class.
This is a single page where you can post some message and it'll store it in a table that has the structure
given in the file chat.sql.

A way to improve this chatwould be to use a script that creates the table needed with a simple request using
the fact that the pdo integrates the use of sqlite easily. The table don't have to be created each time though.
TO be sure that the table would be created I would just have to put a require_once on the page of the chat.

Since then i've evolved a lot because a professor taught me how a real server really work.
I learnt how to handle the public_html repository and where to store the script that i don't
want the user to access to.
