--Currently learning how to use Symfony--

I've done some research out of school time to learn some more about Php.
I know a lot of additional thing that are used with the OOP 
(reflexivity,traits, how to surcharge a magic constructor, how to use 
wisely the concept of heritage, take care of the scope).

Note : Starting from 01/18/2016 I will be working part-time in an academical project
involving Symfony for two semesters .
As there is a confidentiality clause signed over this project i 
can't say much there so reach me out directly to get some information.

Grade scale from o to ++++

What i'm good at : 
- Algorithm ++++
- Using the different data structures ++++
- Programming the object-oriented way ++++

How did I learn ?
*First by my own using some Mooc, the documentation and playing on CodingGames.com .
*Finally at school as i've followed the Web technologies class.
