This project is about discovering and handling real-time connection.
This is a realtime todolist that can be shared so that eveyone see
the progress of the task done.
The real struggle was to do the app.js file. It's pretty simple once
written but pretty hard to understand from someone who started from 0.

What i could have improve :
- The UI but this wasn't the purpose
- Set some percentage to each task
