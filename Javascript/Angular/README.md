During my final internship (Apr-Sep 2017),I had the occasion to get my hands on AngularJs.
The Frontend was mostly done so I just had little changes to work on like :
* Build a service;
* Modify a directive;
* Build a filter.

I had times to follow an Angular 4 tutorial. I learned Typescript in order to get it. I will be putting some work here soon.
