This project was the third one that i've developed when i learned by myself how to handle J2EE.
It's an application that is used to translate manually the subtitles of a video (.srt).
It may not work in other computers as i've used a database to store the datas.
I've used the driver jdbc that you can find in the class DaoFactory.
It's optimize for Apache Tomcat Server but it works perfectly on other servers too.
