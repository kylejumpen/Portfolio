I'm used to work with Android Studio and not Eclipse.
Android Studio makes it easier to test and to sort 
the different files where they need to be.

I'm working on a project by my own that i keep in another file.
You can check this at http://kylejumpen.github.io/Spark or you can ask me some details about it .
