I'm used to work with Android Studio.
Android Studio makes it easier to test and to sort 
the different files where they need to be.
I followed a MooC on Openclassroom.

Grade scale from o to ++++

What i'm good at : 
- Algorithm ++++
- Using the different data structures( Array,Set,List,Map) ++++
- Handling the R class (because that's the real deal) +++

What i need to improve :
- Material Design o
- Learn to program with a cross-platfrom IDE (Xamarin or IONIC) o

How did I learn ?
* On my own using some Moocs and reading a Book ( "Créer une application Android" from Fréderic ESPIAU).
