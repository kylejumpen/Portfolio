Java is special to me, It's the one with I've learnt the Oriented-Object Programmation thanks to Professor Lapalme( http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/lapalme/ ).
This is the language I'm the most efficent with. 

I've been a trainee at Capgemini for 6 months (April-September 2017). During this internship I had the opportunity to use a lot of technologies combined to Java.
Now I feel confident saying that I can use :
* Spring Boot ++++
* Hibernate (ORM) +++
* Spring MVC ++

For Spring MVC, I'm good when it comes to use annotations but I don't master the XML configurations needed sometimes.
