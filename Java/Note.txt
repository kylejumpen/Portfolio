Java is special to me, it's the one with i've learnt the Oriented-Object Programmation thanks to Professor Lapalme( http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/lapalme/ ).
This is the language i'm the most efficent with. 
Basically when i receive and algorithmic problem, i write the pseudocode for it then i translate it in Java and finally i translate it in the language needed.
