Here are some Project that I've worked on.

1. *HibernateTuto*  is the project with whom I've discovered Hibernate ORM. This is a bottom-up ORM which means
I had an existing database to work with. 

2. *course-api-data* is the project with whom I've discovered Spring-boot. I used Apache Derby there to embed a database. I coupled it with hibernate in order to make it easy.
